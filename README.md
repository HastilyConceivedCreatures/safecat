# Safecat
![safecat logo, generated by stable diffusion and gimp](https://neiman.co.il/images/safecat.png)

A simple CLI tool to generate, sign, and verify digital signatures using EdDSA *Baby Jubjub Elliptic Curve* signatures and a *Poseidon hash function*.

See [the announcement article](http://neimanslab.org/2024-02-19/safecat.html) for more details.

## compile
Install Rust, and run `cargo build`.

## usage
1. `safecat generate`. Generates a new EdDSA Baby Jubjub Elliptic Curve private-public key.

    The private key is saved in a file `priv.key`, which is not encrypted! Unsafe indeed.

2. `safecat show`. Shows the last generated private-public keys. You can choose which format to show, hex or detailed. You need "detailed" if you want to verify the signature in Noir, and "hex" if you verify with safecat.

    Here's how you show the detailed format:
    ```
    safecat show --format detailed
    ```
    and here's how you show the hex format:
    ```
    safecat show --format hex
    ```

3. `safecat sign "message"`. Signs a message using the last generated private-public key. By default, the message is hashed using the Poseidon hash function, but you can change it to SHA-256 using the --hash option. You can also choose a format as before.
    ```
    safecat sign --hash sha256 --format hex "hello world"
    ```

4. `safecat verify "message" <signature> <public key>`. Verifies an existing signature of a message. By default, it assumed the message was hashed using Poseidon, but you can change it to SHA-256 using the --hash option like before. The signature and public key must be given in a hex form. 

    Verify commands are a bit long since the signature and public keys are long, so here's an example of how to use them. It doesn't look pretty.
    ```
    safecat verify "hello world" 245a157dc8e23ea8a0ab41b1c2d95ee7d59db5b76cba54b6f10630e5e0aefbdd140996400320386a9a2ec4b06ea7d1c885cd311751445ea171af1ab64dba5ace0420d34429497da49443ae35deb8e3daa745dc0e776df3703640078a67982cad 12055e5d761fd705d1f234770fc55b2cfdfd91e741d8f43b2a88cb5a88f9c1c01061ca2f21151da2903e7ccdf11dbda65c20851dd1df4ac522431041ea1738f9
    ```

## Limitations
Poseidon hash is limited to strings of 496 characters.
